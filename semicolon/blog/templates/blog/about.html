<!-- for a better code-reading experience, all repeated code in templates
were moved to 'base.html' and only the unique codes will remain.
so we will override the 'content' block in the 'base.html' with the code below -->
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}
{% block content%}
  <!--The code below is the way we can write python code within html 
  (note: all statements need to be ended. e.g:endfor ot endif)-->
	<h1>About semiColon</h1>

{% endblock content %}
