# Django based blog application

This is "semicolon"!
A place for programmers to write whatever they want.
feel free to use ;)



sign up. post. update. delete. discuss!

This is a place you can write what's on your mind. 
You can sign up and add a profile picture and edit it anytime.
You can write posts and give updates on them and/or delete them anytime you wish.
Of course, for the ones implementing this project, there is an admin page with a beautiful GUI so you can manage users and other admin-related things.

There will be updates soon maybe on styling and newer features and i'll be happy to see anyone helping me on this project


P.S: This project was first made based on a tutorial by https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g.
